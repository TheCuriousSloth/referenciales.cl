# Reference Database for Appraisal 📊
Project developed with Next.js 14 App Router

## Project Status
🚧 **Under active development** 🚧

### Currently Working On:
- Strengthening the authentication system with Google 🔒
- Optimizing the reference entry form 📝

## Description
Management system for real estate appraisal references with:
- Authentication via Google OAuth 2.0 🔐
- Protected admin panel 🛡️
- Reference management (create, read, update, delete) 📋
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM and PostGIS extension for spatial data 🗺️

In the initial phase, we focus on collaboratively creating the database 🤝.
